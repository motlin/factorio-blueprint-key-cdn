The challenge of maintaining individuality within a community: When transitioning to college, one of the challenges students may face is the potential loss of their individuality amidst the larger college community. While being part of a community can provide support and a sense of belonging, it is important for students to stay true to themselves and retain their unique identity. The pressure to conform or assimilate to the norms and expectations of the college community can make it difficult to express one's individuality. It requires finding a balance between engaging with the community while still embracing one's own values, beliefs, and interests.

The challenge of independence and responsibility: Another significant challenge for first-year college students is learning how to navigate the newfound independence and increased responsibilities. Moving away from home and entering college often means taking charge of various aspects of life, such as managing finances, making decisions about one's academic path, personal well-being, and overall lifestyle choices. This newfound freedom can be exciting, but it also requires students to develop effective time management skills, make responsible choices, and prioritize their academic and personal commitments. Learning how to strike a balance between independence and responsibility can be a learning curve for many first-year students.

The challenge of adapting to a new environment: Starting college at a new institution, such as Arizona State University, presents the challenge of adjusting to a different environment. This includes adapting to the campus culture, finding one's way around the campus, and navigating the academic and social landscape of the university. Adjusting to a new living situation, whether it's living in dorms or finding off-campus housing, can also pose challenges. Students may need to familiarize themselves with the resources and support services available on campus, seek out new social connections, and become acclimated to the overall atmosphere of the university. It takes time and effort to establish a sense of belonging and comfort within the new environment.
